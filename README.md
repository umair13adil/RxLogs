### PLog and DataLog (Loggers)
##### `A file based advanced logging framework written in Kotlin`.

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/umair13adil/RxLogs.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#umair13adil/RxLogs)

Overview
--------

PLogs provides quick & simple file logging solution. All logs are saved to files in storage path provided. These logs are helpful when developer wants to analyze user activities within the app. A new log file is created every hour on a user event. These logs can be filtered and sorted easily. Logs can easily be exported as zip file base on filter type. This zip file can be uploaded to server on export. PLogs also provide functionality to arrange data logs into a predefined directory structure. These logs can be used for a specific events within the app. Logs can be saved as encrypted data.

Setup
-------------

Add module to your project:

## Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
    allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
## Step 2. Add the dependency

```groovy
    dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.umair13adil:RxLogs:[Latest_Version]'
    }
```
    
Usage
-------------

Add following implementation in your Application class.

```kotlin
class MainApplication : Application() {
    
        override fun onCreate() {
            super.onCreate()
    
            setUpPLogger() //Initialize PLogger here
        }

private fun setUpPLogger() {
             val logsPath = "PLogs"
             
                     val logsConfig = LogsConfig(
                             isDebuggable = true,
                             savePath = logsPath,
                             zipFileName = "MyLogs",
                             exportPath = logsPath + File.separator + "PLogsOutput"
                     )

                     PLog.applyConfigurations(logsConfig, saveToFile = true, context = context) //Initialize configurations
                   
         }
}
```

#### Logs retention and auto-clear
_______________________________________________

- When `autoClearLogs = true` and `logsRetentionPeriodInDays = x`, only logs older than (today - x days) are deleted.
- Recent logs (from the last x days including today) are preserved.
- On first run (no previous clear date), the same selective cleanup is applied.

Programmatic helper to apply retention immediately:

```kotlin
// Deletes only logs older than the cutoff. Keeps recent logs.
PLog.clearLogsOlderThan(x)
```

Notes:
- Works with `DirectoryStructure.FOR_DATE`, `FOR_EVENT`, and `SINGLE_FILE_FOR_DAY` using `ddMMyyyy` day prefixes.
- `autoClearLogs` must be true for automatic cleanup triggered by the library.

#### Where are my logs stored?
_______________________________________________
 
 Your logs can be found in the path of your app's directory in storage:
 
*--> Android/data/[YOUR_APP_PACKAGE]/files/[YOUR_LOGS_FOLDER_NAME]/Logs/*
 
 ![Image3](pictures/picture3.png)

#### To Log data to file simply call like this
_______________________________________________

**1. Simple Info Log**

```kotlin
    PLog.logThis(TAG, "method_name", "Log: " + Math.random(), LogLevel.INFO)
```

**2. Simple Warning Log**

```kotlin
    PLog.logThis(TAG, "method_name", "This is a warning message!", LogLevel.WARNING)
```

**3. Error Log**

```kotlin
    PLog.logThis(TAG, "method_name", "This is a error message!", LogLevel.ERROR)
```

**4. Severe Log**

```kotlin
    PLog.logThis(TAG, "method_name", "This is a severe error message!", LogLevel.SEVERE)
```

**5. Exception Log**

```kotlin
    PLog.logThis(TAG, "reportError", Exception("This is an Exception!"))
```

**6. Throwable Log**

```kotlin
    PLog.logThis(TAG, "reportError", Throwable("This is an Throwable!"))
```

**7. Exception Log with Info**

```kotlin
    PLog.logThis(TAG, "reportError", info = "Some Info", exception = Exception("This is an Exception!"), level =  LogLevel.ERROR)
```

**8. Throwable Log with Info**

```kotlin
    PLog.logThis(TAG, "reportError", info = "Some Info", throwable = Throwable("This is an Exception!"), level =  LogLevel.SEVERE)
```

#### ELK Elastic Stack Support
_______________________________________________

To configure set this flag to true:

```kotlin
    PLogMetaInfoProvider.elkStackSupported = true
```

Send additional Meta info for better filtering at LogStash dashboard. This has to be set once on application start.

```kotlin

    PLogMetaInfoProvider.setMetaInfo(MetaInfo(
                /**App**/
                appId = BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID,
                appName = getString(R.string.app_name),
                appVersion = BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME,
                language = "en-US",

                /**Environment**/
                environmentId = BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID,
                environmentName = BuildConfig.BUILD_TYPE,

                /**Organization**/
                organizationId = "9975",
                organizationUnitId = "24",
                organizationName = "BlackBox",

                /**User**/
                userId = "12112",
                userName = "Umair",
                userEmail = "m.umair.adil@gmail.com",
                deviceId = "12",

                /**Device**/
                deviceSerial = "SK-78",
                deviceBrand = Build.BRAND,
                deviceName = Build.DEVICE,
                deviceManufacturer = Build.MANUFACTURER,
                deviceModel = Build.MODEL,
                deviceSdkInt = Build.VERSION.SDK_INT.toString(),
                batteryPercent = "87",

                /**Location**/
                latitude = 0.0,
                longitude = 0.0,

                /**Labels**/
                labels = hashMapOf(Pair("env", "dev"))
        ))
```

#### Enable MQTT Feature
_______________________________________________

**Note:** PLogger currently supports SSL connection for MQTT.

#### Step 1: 
Add certificate in your app's raw resource directory.

##### Step 2: 
Add following block for initializing MQTT logging.

```kotlin
        PLogMQTTProvider.initMQTTClient(applicationContext,
                topic = "YOUR_TOPIC",
                brokerUrl = "YOUR_URL", //Without Scheme
                certificateRes = R.raw.m2mqtt_ca,
                clientId = "5aa39cef4d544d658ecaf23db701099c",
                writeLogsToLocalStorage = true,
                initialDelaySecondsForPublishing = 30,
                debug = true
        )
```

That's it, MQTT setup is done.
